### r/InternetIsBeautiful
**Title**: I built Chroma - a color vision challenge that gets insanely hard. Most people can't get past level 15.
**Body**: Find the one tile that's a different shade. Sounds easy, right? The grid gets bigger and the differences get more subtle with each level. It tests your actual color perception ability. Mobile friendly, no signup needed. What level can you reach?

### r/WebGames
**Title**: Chroma - Progressive color perception challenge (find the odd tile out)
**Body**: Simple but addictive color vision game. Tap the tile that's a slightly different shade. Grid grows from 2x2 to 8x8 and colors get harder to distinguish. Timer adds pressure. Built it this weekend. What's your high score?

### r/CasualGames
**Title**: Quick color perception game - how sharp are your eyes?
**Body**: I made a simple game where you find the differently colored tile in a grid. Gets really hard around level 15 when the differences are super subtle. Takes about 2 minutes per round. Challenge link included so you can compete with friends.

### r/gaming
**Title**: [OC] Made a free browser game that tests your color perception - most of my friends can't beat level 12
**Body**: It's called Chroma - find the odd shade in an increasingly difficult grid. No ads, no login, works on mobile. The color differences get insanely subtle. My best is level 19. What can you get?

### r/webdev (Show and Tell)
**Title**: I built a viral-ready color vision game in a day with Vite + TypeScript + Supabase
**Body**: Tech stack: Vanilla TypeScript, Vite for bundling, Supabase for analytics, hosted on Supabase Storage. ~500 lines of code total. Sound effects use Web Audio API (no files). The game tests color perception with progressive difficulty. Sharing mechanic built in. Would love feedback on the implementation.

### r/IndieGaming
**Title**: Chroma - a minimalist color perception game I made this weekend
**Body**: Find the different shade, beat the clock. Simple concept but it gets surprisingly addictive. Built with TypeScript, no frameworks. Challenge your friends with a share link.

I built a color vision challenge called Chroma

Find the one tile that's a different shade. Grid gets bigger, differences get subtler.

Most people can't get past level 15. Can you?

The game is pure HTML/CSS/JS - no frameworks, ~500 lines of code. Sound effects are procedural (Web Audio API). Analytics via Supabase.

Built it in one day as an experiment in viral game design.

What makes it work:
- Zero learning curve (understand in 2 seconds)
- Speed pressure (timer counts down)
- Challenge link (beat my score)
- Emoji result sharing (like Wordle)
- Progressive difficulty that feels fair
