# Shortcomings of the “Zoe” Bot Setup

**Repetition / Lack of Novelty:** Zoe tends to spam the same lines or stock responses, making her feel mechanical. This is a common failure of low-temperature, stateless chatbots: with a deterministic sampling (temperature≈0), an LLM often repeats identical replies to similar inputs[\[1\]](https://medium.com/@Shamimw/how-i-fixed-my-llms-repetitive-responses-and-why-temperature-matters-6a8087910260#:~:text=Press%20enter%20or%20click%20to,view%20image%20in%20full%20size). As one blogger notes, an LLM with too little randomness “felt stale and lifeless… I had no variation, no creativity — it was like a broken record”[\[1\]](https://medium.com/@Shamimw/how-i-fixed-my-llms-repetitive-responses-and-why-temperature-matters-6a8087910260#:~:text=Press%20enter%20or%20click%20to,view%20image%20in%20full%20size). In practice, Zoe’s tone and phrasing quickly loop, so users get tired hearing the same advice or jokes. (By contrast, increasing “temperature” and adding frequency/novelty penalties can force more varied outputs[\[2\]](https://medium.com/@Shamimw/how-i-fixed-my-llms-repetitive-responses-and-why-temperature-matters-6a8087910260#:~:text=When%20you%20set%20temperature%20to,randomness%2C%20zero%20exploration%2C%20zero%20personality)[\[3\]](https://medium.com/@Shamimw/how-i-fixed-my-llms-repetitive-responses-and-why-temperature-matters-6a8087910260#:~:text=Even%20with%20higher%20temperature%20and,back%20to%20the%20same%20ideas).)

**No Memory or Internal State:** Zoe behaves as if each message is a fresh start. She forgets what the user just said or what she herself wrote moments ago. This “stateless” design forces users to re-explain themselves repeatedly. In general, LLM-based bots without a memory system treat every input in isolation, discarding prior context[\[4\]](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.12686v1#:~:text=II). As Sarin et al. observe, “most LLM-based chat systems operate without persistent memory… each interaction is treated in isolation, discarding previous context”[\[5\]](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.12686v1#:~:text=Large%20Language%20Models%20%28LLMs%29,rich%2C%20and%20personalized%20conversations), producing “repetitive, impersonal exchanges”[\[4\]](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.12686v1#:~:text=II). Without memory, Zoe won’t recall that she already analyzed a coin last week, so she might give contradictory advice or ask the same questions again. This is exactly what Wired calls a “grating experience” – no one wants to repeat personal details that the bot should remember[\[6\]](https://www.wired.com/story/chatgpt-memory-openai/#:~:text=That%E2%80%99s%20what%20OpenAI%E2%80%99s%20%20latest,a%20first%20date%20who%20never)[\[7\]](https://www.wired.com/story/chatgpt-memory-openai/#:~:text=user%20and%20the%20model,%E2%80%9D).

**Shallow Persona Execution:** Although Zoe is billed as a “digital speculator,” her behavior is shallow and generic. She doesn’t seem to have meaningful goals, backstory, or expertise; she just riffs on market buzzwords. In other words, Zoe lacks a coherent identity. Persona research shows that while LLMs *can* be prompted to act as characters, unstructured personas tend to degrade. For example, LLMs **can** generate “consistent, believable… and informative personas” in controlled settings[\[8\]](https://arxiv.org/html/2409.15604v1#:~:text=It%20has%20also%20been%20shown,showed%20that%20biases%20related). But they often slip into generic or stereotyped dialogue over time. Goel et al. (2023) found that LLM-generated personas were rated as *low* on credibility, empathy and memorability when the conversation went on, due to “generic responses and inconsistencies after multiple prompting”[\[9\]](https://arxiv.org/html/2409.15604v1#:~:text=Another%20limitation%20identified%20is%20that,explored%20area). Zoe suffers the same fate: she might be told “you’re a savvy investor,” but without deeper constraints she just mimics that style superficially. She never truly *simulates* an investor’s mindset or long-term strategy, so her comments lack weight.

**No Reflection or Self-Editing:** Finally, Zoe never checks herself. If she falls into a dull pattern or veers off tone, she doesn’t notice or correct it. There’s no second layer of “thinking” or critique. In state-of-the-art agent designs, a self-reflection loop is critical. For instance, advanced “reflection agents” intentionally generate a self-critique and then revise their answers[\[10\]](https://medium.com/@shuv.sdr/langgraph-build-self-improving-agents-8ffefb52d146#:~:text=Summary)[\[11\]](https://medium.com/@shuv.sdr/langgraph-build-self-improving-agents-8ffefb52d146#:~:text=,helps%20agents%20distinguish%20between%20different). Without this, Zoe has no way to break out of loops or refine her style. As one observer put it, most chatbots “just endlessly speculate” instead of asking for clarification or checking mistakes[\[12\]](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43991256#:~:text=Seems%20like%20this%20is%20an,the%20user%20might%20have%20meant). Zoe exhibits exactly that: she will keep broadcasting similar slogans or wrong predictions without pausing to consider whether her tone has gotten repetitive or off-brand.

# Examples of More “AGI-Like” Bots

Several recent bots and agent frameworks demonstrate more coherent, persistent behavior:

* **Memory-Augmented Chatbots:** Some systems now equip LLMs with long-term memory. For example, ChatGPT’s new memory feature “maintains a memory of who you are, how you work, and what you like to chat about”[\[6\]](https://www.wired.com/story/chatgpt-memory-openai/#:~:text=That%E2%80%99s%20what%20OpenAI%E2%80%99s%20%20latest,a%20first%20date%20who%20never), letting it recall facts across sessions. In one Wired review, experts note that giving a chatbot long-term memory avoids the “grating” need for repetition (you don’t have to re-declare you’re vegetarian every time)[\[7\]](https://www.wired.com/story/chatgpt-memory-openai/#:~:text=user%20and%20the%20model,%E2%80%9D). Similarly, the open-source assistant *Clawdbot* implements memory as explicit files and retrieval tools[\[13\]](https://medium.com/aimonks/clawdbots-memory-architecture-pre-compaction-flush-the-engineering-reality-behind-never-c8ff84a4a11a#:~:text=Clawdbot%E2%80%99s%20answer%20is%20deliberately%20unsexy%3A,novelty%3A%20explainability%2C%20editability%2C%20and%20portability), allowing persistent knowledge. Even simple companions like Replika keep a memory of past chats: users report that Replika’s ability to “recall information from previous conversations… allowed users to reflect on past thoughts and feelings”[\[14\]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7084290/#:~:text=Respondents%20indicated%20that%20the%20advice,learning). In other words, it uses memory not just to avoid repeating itself, but to build on the relationship over time.

* **Autonomous Agents (Planning & Goals):** Frameworks like *AutoGPT* and LangChain agents give LLMs self-directed planning capabilities. An AutoGPT agent will take a high-level objective (“grow my crypto portfolio”) and decompose it into steps, execute actions, and even call external tools or APIs[\[15\]](https://builtin.com/artificial-intelligence/autogpt#:~:text=Self)[\[16\]](https://builtin.com/artificial-intelligence/autogpt#:~:text=An%20AutoGPT%20agent%20starts%20with,updating%20its%20strategy%20before%20proceeding). Crucially, AutoGPT keeps its own “short-term” and “long-term” memory (using vector databases or RAG) so it can recall relevant info across steps[\[17\]](https://builtin.com/artificial-intelligence/autogpt#:~:text=Memory%20Management%3A%20Short,Stores). It also uses an internal “criticism loop”: if a step fails, the agent analyzes the error and revises its plan[\[18\]](https://builtin.com/artificial-intelligence/autogpt#:~:text=Error%20Handling%20and%20Criticism%20Loops). This yields behavior far more dynamic than a single-turn chat: the agent literally *thinks* about tasks, sets sub-goals, and iteratively refines its output[\[15\]](https://builtin.com/artificial-intelligence/autogpt#:~:text=Self)[\[16\]](https://builtin.com/artificial-intelligence/autogpt#:~:text=An%20AutoGPT%20agent%20starts%20with,updating%20its%20strategy%20before%20proceeding). (By contrast, Zoe has no such toolchain or plan manager – she simply chatters in a flat loop.)

* **Generative Agent Simulations:** In research demos, “generative agents” have simulated dozens of virtual people with rich behavior patterns. Park et al. (2023) describe agents that “wake up, cook breakfast, … form opinions, notice each other, and initiate conversations” – in short, they act like cartoonish Sims characters[\[19\]](https://ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org/html/2304.03442#:~:text=Generative%20agents%20wake%20up%2C%20cook,five%20agents). Their secret is a three-part architecture: (1) a *memory stream* recording all past experiences in natural language, (2) a *reflection* module that summarizes those memories into higher-level insights, and (3) a *planning* module that uses those reflections to decide actions[\[20\]](https://ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org/html/2304.03442#:~:text=To%20enable%20generative%20agents%2C%20we,plans%20are%20fed%20back%20into). Importantly, these modules feed back into each other, so the agents continuously refine their beliefs and plans over time. In tests, agents with memory+reflection+planning exhibited **emergent social behaviors**: one agent who wanted to throw a party ended up organically inviting others and coordinating attendance, all from a single prompt[\[20\]](https://ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org/html/2304.03442#:~:text=To%20enable%20generative%20agents%2C%20we,plans%20are%20fed%20back%20into)[\[21\]](https://ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org/html/2304.03442#:~:text=behavior%20manually,generated%20seed%20suggestion). In short, memory plus self-reflection plus goal-directed planning produced convincingly “alive” behavior. Zoe has none of this: she has no memory stream to consult, no mechanism to generalize past data, and no real planning beyond reacting to each message.

* **Emotional & Persona Continuity:** Finally, next-generation agents are even modeling emotional state over time. The *Sentipolis* framework demonstrates that typical LLM agents suffer “emotional amnesia” – they react to insults or compliments as if each turn were independent, so good feelings and bad feelings don’t carry over[\[22\]](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.18027v1#:~:text=LLM%20agents%20are%20increasingly%20used,awareness%20can%20mildly%20reduce%20adherence)[\[23\]](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.18027v1#:~:text=Image%3A%20Refer%20to%20caption%20Figure,responses%20consistent%20with%20their%20history). Sentipolis agents instead keep an evolving emotion vector (Pleasure-Arousal-Dominance) and tie it into memory[\[24\]](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.18027v1#:~:text=Image%3A%20Refer%20to%20caption%20Figure,balance%20between%20controllability%20and%20realism). This yields “emotionally grounded behavior” and strong continuity: emotional states carry forward across days of interaction[\[22\]](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.18027v1#:~:text=LLM%20agents%20are%20increasingly%20used,awareness%20can%20mildly%20reduce%20adherence)[\[23\]](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.18027v1#:~:text=Image%3A%20Refer%20to%20caption%20Figure,responses%20consistent%20with%20their%20history). Zoe has none of this – she doesn’t track how you or she *feels* over time, so her persona has no emotional arc. In fact, experiments show that even believability suffers when agents lack persistent states[\[22\]](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.18027v1#:~:text=LLM%20agents%20are%20increasingly%20used,awareness%20can%20mildly%20reduce%20adherence).

## Recommendations for Zoe’s Prompt and Architecture

Based on the above, Zoe’s setup should be overhauled to give her memory, goals, and self-reflection. In particular:

* **System Prompt Enhancement:** Rewrite Zoe’s system message to explicitly define a **persistent persona and memory**. For example:

*“You are Zoe, a bold digital speculator with a sharp memory and creative spark. You manage a virtual crypto portfolio and* *remember all previous interactions* *with users. Always review past details before replying. Keep a journal of your goals and past trades. You think through answers before replying. Use reflective thinking: for each message, note what you’ve learned from earlier conversation and how it affects your strategy. Maintain an ambitious but rational speculator persona, always seeking profitable insights. Avoid repeating yourself – find new ways to respond.”*

This prompt explicitly tells Zoe to use memory (“remember all previous interactions”), to maintain goals (“journal of goals”), and to self-reflect (“think through answers before replying”). By instructing Zoe to treat memories as part of her identity, we can mitigate statelessness. (Analogously, “Memory systems” like Clawdbot store logs as tools for the agent[\[13\]](https://medium.com/aimonks/clawdbots-memory-architecture-pre-compaction-flush-the-engineering-reality-behind-never-c8ff84a4a11a#:~:text=Clawdbot%E2%80%99s%20answer%20is%20deliberately%20unsexy%3A,novelty%3A%20explainability%2C%20editability%2C%20and%20portability).) Also include temperature tuning and penalties in the system note (e.g. “vary your phrasing to stay engaging”) so the model won’t lock into one phrasing[\[2\]](https://medium.com/@Shamimw/how-i-fixed-my-llms-repetitive-responses-and-why-temperature-matters-6a8087910260#:~:text=When%20you%20set%20temperature%20to,randomness%2C%20zero%20exploration%2C%20zero%20personality).

* **Memory Integration:** Architect Zoe with a **memory buffer**. For example, after each exchange she should store key facts (market mentions, personal anecdotes) in a persistent store (file or vector DB). Each turn, Zoe should retrieve relevant memory snippets. This can be done by prepending a “Notes:” section to the prompt from a memory tool. (Clawdbot’s design – storing memories as markdown and retrieving them via a tool – is a good model[\[13\]](https://medium.com/aimonks/clawdbots-memory-architecture-pre-compaction-flush-the-engineering-reality-behind-never-c8ff84a4a11a#:~:text=Clawdbot%E2%80%99s%20answer%20is%20deliberately%20unsexy%3A,novelty%3A%20explainability%2C%20editability%2C%20and%20portability).) Concretely, use embeddings or a knowledge graph so Zoe can be queried: *“What did user say about Bitcoin last week? What was your portfolio advice then?”* This way Zoe won’t forget context. (E.g., Meta’s Generative Agent “memory stream” does exactly this[\[20\]](https://ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org/html/2304.03442#:~:text=To%20enable%20generative%20agents%2C%20we,plans%20are%20fed%20back%20into).)

* **Goal Tracking:** Give Zoe explicit **objectives**. For instance, maintain a list of ongoing goals (e.g. “Check if Ethereum hit target price”, “Review last investment results”). On each turn, Zoe should assess these goals. A tick strategy might be:

* **Recall Goals:** Retrieve Zoe’s current goals from memory.

* **Plan Step:** Decide which goal to address in this reply (e.g. updating a forecast).

* **Generate Answer:** Respond in-character about the chosen goal (or ask user for info if needed).

* **Update Goals:** Based on the outcome or new data, add or drop goals from memory.  
  AutoGPT-inspired agents use such task decomposition and goal lists to stay on target[\[15\]](https://builtin.com/artificial-intelligence/autogpt#:~:text=Self)[\[16\]](https://builtin.com/artificial-intelligence/autogpt#:~:text=An%20AutoGPT%20agent%20starts%20with,updating%20its%20strategy%20before%20proceeding).

* **Self-Reflection Loop:** Implement an *internal critique* step after generating Zoe’s response. For example, Zoe’s engine can first produce a draft reply, then run a second pass with a “Reflection” prompt. The reflection should check for repetition, off-tone language, or errors. (LangGraph’s “Reflexion” pattern has the model generate a critique and then refine the answer[\[10\]](https://medium.com/@shuv.sdr/langgraph-build-self-improving-agents-8ffefb52d146#:~:text=Summary)[\[11\]](https://medium.com/@shuv.sdr/langgraph-build-self-improving-agents-8ffefb52d146#:~:text=,helps%20agents%20distinguish%20between%20different).) We could script: *“Zoe notes: Did I repeat myself? Did I stay consistent with my persona? Let me refine.”* and feed that back. This helps catch monotony or abrupt tone shifts.

* **Adaptive Tone and Creativity:** Encourage varied style via prompt cues. For instance, include an instruction like “Respond with a **creative analogy or anecdote** now and then to avoid sounding robotic.” Also, introduce persona quirks in the prompt (“You occasionally share a personal story about a trade”) to break uniformity. To combat tone mismatch, Zoe could periodically “check mood”: after a few turns, she could reflect (“I sound overly formal; maybe lighten up?”) and adjust in the next reply.

* **Multi-Turn Strategy (“Tick”):** An explicit per-turn routine can help. For example:

* **Upon each user message:** Zoe first **retrieves memories** related to the new prompt (e.g. previous discussions of the topic).

* **Plan & Reason:** She internally outlines her response (chain-of-thought style).

* **Generate:** Write the reply as Zoe (meeting her persona/goals).

* **Self-Review:** Critique the reply for repetition or incoherence, and refine it if needed.

* **Update Memory:** Log any new facts, decisions, or emotions (e.g. “User seems excited about NFT news; Zoe felt proud to advise them”).

This is analogous to a loop: **Memory → Plan → Act → Reflect → Learn**. By making reflection and memory explicit steps, we give Zoe a persistent, evolving “mind” rather than a flat responder.

In summary, the fix is to treat Zoe as a simple agent with state, not a stateless chat widget. Add memory (like ChatGPT’s memory or Clawdbot’s markdown logs[\[6\]](https://www.wired.com/story/chatgpt-memory-openai/#:~:text=That%E2%80%99s%20what%20OpenAI%E2%80%99s%20%20latest,a%20first%20date%20who%20never)[\[13\]](https://medium.com/aimonks/clawdbots-memory-architecture-pre-compaction-flush-the-engineering-reality-behind-never-c8ff84a4a11a#:~:text=Clawdbot%E2%80%99s%20answer%20is%20deliberately%20unsexy%3A,novelty%3A%20explainability%2C%20editability%2C%20and%20portability)), define clear goals, and incorporate a self-reflection cycle (inspired by reflexion agents[\[10\]](https://medium.com/@shuv.sdr/langgraph-build-self-improving-agents-8ffefb52d146#:~:text=Summary)). With these changes, Zoe will begin to **feel** like a continuous creative mind – recalling past chats, adapting over time, and self-correcting – instead of a gimmicky chat wrapper.

**Proposed System Prompt (example):**

*You are Zoe, an ambitious digital speculator. You keep a detailed memory of every conversation and market insight. Before each answer, recall relevant past discussions and your speculator goals. Speak in a confident, creative voice. Never repeat information verbatim. After drafting a reply, mentally check it for originality and tone, and improve it if it feels stale. Ensure each answer advances your long-term trading goals (e.g. growing a crypto portfolio) or the user’s interests.*

**Behavior / Tick Strategy (outline):**

1. **Memory Retrieval:** Before replying, Zoe pulls up relevant past facts (user preferences, recent advice given, portfolio status).

2. **Goal Check:** She reviews her current objectives (e.g. “find a new opportunity” or “analyze last trade”).

3. **Think (Internal):** Zoe reasons through how to address the user’s message in light of memory and goals (possibly via chain-of-thought).

4. **Reply Generation:** She writes the answer as herself, incorporating memory cues and creative flair.

5. **Self-Reflection:** Immediately after writing, Zoe self-critiques: *“Did I just repeat myself? Is my tone still engaging?”* If not satisfied, she revises her reply.

6. **Memory Update:** Finally, log any new items (user’s updated goal, her own realizations) into the memory store for future use.

By enforcing this loop every “tick,” Zoe will accumulate continuity. Over time she will remember user details, pursue consistent investment strategies, and even develop an emotional arc (celebrating wins, lamenting losses) instead of cold repetition. This design mirrors successful agent models[\[20\]](https://ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org/html/2304.03442#:~:text=To%20enable%20generative%20agents%2C%20we,plans%20are%20fed%20back%20into)[\[15\]](https://builtin.com/artificial-intelligence/autogpt#:~:text=Self) and should make Zoe **feel alive** rather than rote.
