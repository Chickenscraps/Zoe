    "content": "-\n\n\nDue to the bloated size of this classroom and, additionally, the 20 contractors that required webcams, every student had connection issues throughout the entire presentation. There is no way this class could be considered compliant. Trying to keep the class under control with the plethora of issues that arose was near impossible because of the bandwidth required to run 20 webcams and up to 40 other students. As a result of these issues, the classroom had to remain Unlocked because the knocking was almost constant and very disruptive, so it was very difficult to tell who did or did not answer the attendance polls as the class was basically a revolving door of disconnects and reconnects. It is simply way too much for the modest devices and internet connections students have access to. This is also extremely unfair to the students that don't need webcams, as the contractors are the ones causing the technical issues. It makes more sense to separate them. The size of these contractor classes have been a huge concern of mine that I have previously voiced, yet, they continue. At this point, it's in my opinion that this is passed the point of compliance and is breaching concerns on an ethical level because the students are NOT getting the product they paid for due to an issue that was addressed, acknowledged, AND ultimately, not corrected. This is all coming from a place of wanting to make sure that Kaplan is at it's best and that the students' investments are protected, neither of which happened with this course.",
