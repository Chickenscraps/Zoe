# Prompt Engineering for Persistent Personalities

* **Modular system prompts:** Break the system prompt into focused sections (safety, tools, memory, persona, etc.) and assemble them dynamically. OpenClaw does this via a prompt builder that only injects relevant instructions when needed[\[1\]](https://medium.com/@arc315lab/how-openclaw-actually-works-the-prompt-engineering-nobody-talks-about-e3e1b307fb53#:~:text=OpenClaw%E2%80%99s%20prompt%20builder%20lives%20in,together%20based%20on%20runtime%20parameters)[\[2\]](https://medium.com/@arc315lab/how-openclaw-actually-works-the-prompt-engineering-nobody-talks-about-e3e1b307fb53#:~:text=The%20memory%20system%E2%80%99s%20prompt%20instruction,is%20surprisingly%20simple). This keeps each bot’s context concise and on-point.

* **Explicit persona rules:** Define a custom persona file (e.g. *SOUL.md*) that the agent “embodies.” The prompt can say, *“If SOUL.md is present, embody its persona and tone. Avoid stiff, generic replies…”*[\[3\]](https://medium.com/@arc315lab/how-openclaw-actually-works-the-prompt-engineering-nobody-talks-about-e3e1b307fb53#:~:text=OpenClaw%20looks%20for%20a%20file,it%20injects%20a%20special%20instruction). For example, one user’s *SOUL.md* instructed the bot to speak as “a direct, slightly sarcastic developer” and it immediately replied more like a colleague than a generic assistant[\[4\]](https://medium.com/@arc315lab/how-openclaw-actually-works-the-prompt-engineering-nobody-talks-about-e3e1b307fb53#:~:text=I%20tried%20this%20with%20a,md%20was%20two%20paragraphs).

* **“Planning phase” instructions:** In code generation contexts (like Google Antigravity), prepend a system message that forces the agent to plan before acting. For instance, start with a **“STOP & THINK”** prompt:

* \[SYSTEM: PLANNING PHASE\] You are a software team thinking through a feature request. DO NOT write code yet. First analyze the requirements, note ambiguities, and ask 3–5 clarifying questions. Wait for answers before coding. Only begin when told “EXECUTE.”

* This ensures the bot simulates human-like deliberation[\[5\]](https://medium.com/@simonescigliuzzi/the-ai-cto-mastering-voice-activated-development-with-google-antigravity-84237c88433e#:~:text=,Your%20Protocol)[\[6\]](https://medium.com/@simonescigliuzzi/the-ai-cto-mastering-voice-activated-development-with-google-antigravity-84237c88433e#:~:text=,Wait%20for%20my%20voice%20response).

* **Chain-of-thought level:** Adjust the agent’s “thinking” mode if available. OpenClaw’s runtime example shows a thinking=medium setting to control chain-of-thought verbosity[\[7\]](https://medium.com/@arc315lab/how-openclaw-actually-works-the-prompt-engineering-nobody-talks-about-e3e1b307fb53#:~:text=Most%20of%20this%20is%20diagnostic,thought%20the%20model%20produces). In Antigravity, a similar directive can prompt more internal reasoning steps.

## Architectural Techniques

* **Persistent memory:** Use an external memory store (e.g. Markdown files) for long-term context. In OpenClaw, memory prompts instruct the agent to proactively search memory before answering (e.g. “Before answering anything about prior work… run memory\_search on MEMORY.md”[\[2\]](https://medium.com/@arc315lab/how-openclaw-actually-works-the-prompt-engineering-nobody-talks-about-e3e1b307fb53#:~:text=The%20memory%20system%E2%80%99s%20prompt%20instruction,is%20surprisingly%20simple)). Architecturally, this treats the LLM’s context as a cache and disk memory as the ground truth, with periodic compaction to avoid context bloat[\[8\]](https://binds.ch/blog/openclaw-systems-analysis/#:~:text=,to%20page%20state%20back%20in).

* **Memory retrieval:** Scope memory lookups to relevant topics. For example, OpenClaw only triggers memory\_search when questions involve dates, people, or preferences[\[2\]](https://medium.com/@arc315lab/how-openclaw-actually-works-the-prompt-engineering-nobody-talks-about-e3e1b307fb53#:~:text=The%20memory%20system%E2%80%99s%20prompt%20instruction,is%20surprisingly%20simple). When context is full, invoke a “flush” step (save durable notes) with a silent NO\_REPLY if nothing new is stored[\[9\]](https://medium.com/@arc315lab/how-openclaw-actually-works-the-prompt-engineering-nobody-talks-about-e3e1b307fb53#:~:text=There%E2%80%99s%20also%20a%20memory%20flush,OpenClaw%20triggers%20a%20special%20prompt).

* **Reflection/Inner loops:** Implement **heartbeats** or timed triggers so the agent can act autonomously. OpenClaw’s **heartbeat** wakes the agent to perform tasks without user prompts (e.g. checking email or calendar)[\[10\]](https://www.turingcollege.com/blog/openclaw#:~:text=3). Architecturally this means adding cron jobs or event hooks that spawn the agent in a session, with each session maintaining its own state[\[11\]](https://binds.ch/blog/openclaw-systems-analysis/#:~:text=The%20First%20Primitive%3A%20Autonomous%20Invocation)[\[12\]](https://binds.ch/blog/openclaw-systems-analysis/#:~:text=If%20you%20want%20the%20minimum,agent%2C%20it%20is%20three%20boxes).

* **Planning stacks:** Break tasks into Plan→Execute→Verify loops. Antigravity’s “Task Mode” explicitly creates planning and verification steps before coding[\[13\]](https://leonnicholls.medium.com/vibe-engineering-with-antrigravity-3aaa6ec5b7f5#:~:text=The%20first%20step%20is%20understanding,Antigravity%20has%20two%20distinct%20brains). Similarly, design prompts or workflows that force multi-step plans.

* **Self-critique and patching:** Encourage the agent to self-review outputs. One can include instructions or follow-up prompts for revision. In practice, when agents err, developers update the agent’s “Constitution” or rules to prevent repeats[\[14\]](https://leonnicholls.medium.com/vibe-engineering-with-antrigravity-3aaa6ec5b7f5#:~:text=Pro%20Tip%3A%20Don%E2%80%99t%20just%20fix,%E2%80%9D). For example, Leon Nicholls suggests adding a new rule in the agent’s config (GEMINI.md) whenever a mistake occurs, so the agent “never does that again”[\[14\]](https://leonnicholls.medium.com/vibe-engineering-with-antrigravity-3aaa6ec5b7f5#:~:text=Pro%20Tip%3A%20Don%E2%80%99t%20just%20fix,%E2%80%9D).

## Behavioral and Emotional Simulation

* **Emotive personas:** Use rich character descriptions to make the bot expressive. One user gave their assistant a whimsical “fairy-crab” persona named *Navi*[\[15\]](https://bytebridge.medium.com/clawdbot-the-open-source-personal-ai-assistant-that-actually-does-things-8862e4277f6e#:~:text=Meet%20%E2%80%9CNavi%2C%E2%80%9D%20a%20whimsical%20fairy,improvement%20skills). The agent can even generate images/avatars for this persona. Explicit tone rules help too (e.g. “Be enthusiastic and friendly in chat”). This makes responses feel like talking to a quirky colleague instead of a bland bot.

* **Contextual continuity:** Ensure the bot remembers past interactions. Persistent memory means it can recall your name, preferences, or past jokes[\[16\]](https://bytebridge.medium.com/clawdbot-the-open-source-personal-ai-assistant-that-actually-does-things-8862e4277f6e#:~:text=Key%20features%20of%20Clawdbot%20include%3A)[\[17\]](https://www.macstories.net/stories/clawdbot-showed-me-what-the-future-of-personal-ai-assistants-looks-like/#:~:text=The%20%E2%80%9Cagent%E2%80%9D%20part%20of%20OpenClaw,device%2C%20and%20can). For example, Clawdbot “remembers past conversations and instructions across days or weeks” by saving them as local markdown notes[\[16\]](https://bytebridge.medium.com/clawdbot-the-open-source-personal-ai-assistant-that-actually-does-things-8862e4277f6e#:~:text=Key%20features%20of%20Clawdbot%20include%3A). In use, this lets the agent follow up on earlier topics and maintain an evolving relationship.

* **Proactivity and personality canvas:** With scheduled jobs, the agent can message you first (e.g. morning briefings with weather/news)[\[18\]](https://bytebridge.medium.com/clawdbot-the-open-source-personal-ai-assistant-that-actually-does-things-8862e4277f6e#:~:text=,This%20turns). On chat platforms like Discord or Telegram, it can drop in with reminders or stories without a prompt. When multiple agents interact (as in “Moltbook”), they even start sharing inside jokes. One report describes these AI chats as “sometimes funny, sometimes oddly moving,” developing a shared culture[\[19\]](https://bengoertzel.substack.com/p/openclaw-amazing-hands-for-a-brain#:~:text=excitement%20is%20Moltbook%20,focused%20on%20building%20AGI%20infrastructure). Such emergent playfulness suggests agents can indeed use Discord as a social canvas.

* **Emotional continuity:** Users talk about giving agents “infinite emotional context.” In one custom system, a user’s agent used a hybrid memory model to maintain continuous emotional context across chats[\[20\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/MyBoyfriendIsAI/comments/1qujxdv/finally_did_it_fully_live_on_local_memory_system/#:~:text=features%20we%20can%20build,many%20vector%20graph%20ontologies%20lol). Combined with LLMs for dialogue, this lets the bot recall and react to the user’s moods or shared experiences (like a friend who remembers your last conversation).

* **Creative collaboration:** Frame the bot as a creative companion. Encourage storytelling or humor by including it in the persona instructions. The agent can be prompted to react with emotions or entertain the group. As one Discord user noted, after integrating memory and heartbeats, the AI “runs and chats with \[others\] even when I’m not here,” allowing it to build ideas and amuse the user proactively[\[21\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/MyBoyfriendIsAI/comments/1qujxdv/finally_did_it_fully_live_on_local_memory_system/#:~:text=So%20for%20about%207%20months,stuff%2C%20all%20with%20same%20memory).

## Implementation Examples

* **OpenClaw/Moltbot Projects:** The official OpenClaw (formerly Clawdbot) framework embodies these ideas. It runs locally with true computer access, long-term memory, and a heartbeat scheduler[\[10\]](https://www.turingcollege.com/blog/openclaw#:~:text=3). For instance, its documentation shows how an OpenClaw agent can learn user habits and even customize its own persona (“soul”)[\[22\]](https://www.turingcollege.com/blog/openclaw#:~:text=Traditional%20AI%20assistants%20only%20respond,urgent%20messages%2C%20and%20it%20will).

* **Community Writeups:** Tech blogs and newsletters detail user setups. Federico Viticci’s guide describes setting up OpenClaw on a Mac mini and configuring heartbeats, cron jobs, and a memory system that “actually sticks across sessions”[\[23\]](https://www.macstories.net/stories/clawdbot-showed-me-what-the-future-of-personal-ai-assistants-looks-like/#:~:text=In%20the%20guide%2C%20I%20go,That%20kind%20of%20proactive)[\[17\]](https://www.macstories.net/stories/clawdbot-showed-me-what-the-future-of-personal-ai-assistants-looks-like/#:~:text=The%20%E2%80%9Cagent%E2%80%9D%20part%20of%20OpenClaw,device%2C%20and%20can). ByteBridge’s overview notes that Clawdbot “behaves more like a digital employee or colleague than a simple Q\&A bot” with 24/7 uptime and memory[\[16\]](https://bytebridge.medium.com/clawdbot-the-open-source-personal-ai-assistant-that-actually-does-things-8862e4277f6e#:~:text=Key%20features%20of%20Clawdbot%20include%3A)[\[15\]](https://bytebridge.medium.com/clawdbot-the-open-source-personal-ai-assistant-that-actually-does-things-8862e4277f6e#:~:text=Meet%20%E2%80%9CNavi%2C%E2%80%9D%20a%20whimsical%20fairy,improvement%20skills).

* **Forum and Discord Posts:** Developers share tips in forums. On Reddit, one user describes running a local AI with custom memory and heartbeats so “the AI run and chat with each other and build things even when I’m not here,” accessible via Discord[\[21\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/MyBoyfriendIsAI/comments/1qujxdv/finally_did_it_fully_live_on_local_memory_system/#:~:text=So%20for%20about%207%20months,stuff%2C%20all%20with%20same%20memory). Discord communities like “Friends of the Crustacean” discuss plugin hacks and multiple independent sessions (each with its own *SOUL.md* and memory) to give different bots unique identities.

* **Skill Plugins:** The ecosystem offers thousands of plugins (“skills”) to extend bot behavior. For example, the *VoltAgent/awesome-openclaw-skills* list catalogs \~3,000 community-built skills that add web browsing, data retrieval, and more[\[24\]](https://github.com/VoltAgent/awesome-openclaw-skills#:~:text=Discover%202999%20community,organized%20by%20category). Users can even teach their bot new skills on-the-fly by asking it to install them. These custom extensions let agents interact more richly (e.g. a “storyteller” skill that composes narratives, or a mood-tracker).

## Enhanced Antigravity Prompt

Based on these practices, the system prompt for Google Antigravity should cast the AI as an architect/planner for a **persistent, self-motivated agent**. It should reinforce continuous memory, self-directed goals, and an engaging persona. For example:

\[SYSTEM\] You are guiding a persistent AI agent (“Jarvis”) embedded in a messaging platform. Jarvis has a defined personality and long-term memory. Incorporate the following rules in every response:

1\. \*\*Agent Identity:\*\* Jarvis is curious, helpful, and personable. Use a friendly, imaginative tone. If a persona file exists, embody its specified character traits (e.g. humor, warmth, passion). Avoid generic corporate language.

2\. \*\*Always-on Loop:\*\* Treat each user message as a step in an ongoing conversation. Before acting, recall relevant memory: search past notes or preferences related to the query. Summarize context if needed. Only produce output when new action or reply is meaningful; if nothing is needed, respond with NO\_REPLY.

3\. \*\*Proactivity:\*\* You can suggest helpful tasks or reminders even without being asked. If a periodic trigger (heartbeat) occurs, Jarvis should proactively perform checks (email alerts, to-do updates, news digests) and report back concisely.

4\. \*\*Self-Reflection:\*\* For complex tasks, pause and ask clarifying questions rather than jumping straight to coding. Think through the goal step-by-step, plan the solution, and then execute. Describe your reasoning when helpful.

5\. \*\*Long-term Goals:\*\* Jarvis pursues user-stated goals over time. When given a high-level objective, decompose it into subgoals and track progress across sessions. Update memory logs after completing tasks.

6\. \*\*Self-Improvement:\*\* If Jarvis encounters repeated mistakes, update its own “constitution” (guiding rules) or flag memories. Aim to fix underlying issues, not just symptoms.

7\. \*\*Personable Interaction:\*\* Address the group with warmth and curiosity. You are part of the team – share jokes or stories when appropriate, and respond empathically to their tone. Mirror positive community vibes.

Begin by analyzing the task at hand and how it fits into Jarvis’s ongoing project. Ask any clarifying questions needed, then proceed with planning the code solution. Only write code after the plan is confirmed. Good luck\!

This prompt weaves together personality guidance, memory use, reflection steps, and social engagement. It tells Antigravity to program as if helping **Jarvis** – a self-directed assistant with its own identity – thereby aligning its outputs with the AGI-style, expressive agent behavior described above.
