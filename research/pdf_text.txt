Improving Clawdbot: A Technical Strategy
Notification Triggers
Clawdbot can proactively alert the user via native Windows toasts (using win11toast
) whenever it needs
attention. For example, wrap key events in FastAPI background tasks: 
from fastapi import FastAPI, BackgroundTasks
from win11toast import toast
app = FastAPI()
def notify_user(title, message):
toast(title, message)
@app.post("/ask_question")
async def ask_question(background_tasks: BackgroundTasks):
question = "I have a question: should I start organizing your tasks for 
today?"
# Trigger a Windows toast notification
background_tasks.add_task(notify_user, "Clawdbot", question)
return {"status": "notification sent"}
Clawdbot might send a toast (and speak it) in scenarios such as: it has a clarification question, its confidence is
low, or it has a helpful suggestion. For example, if the Gemini API response is uncertain or empty, trigger: 
if response.confidence < 0.5:
message = "Hmm, IÆm not sure about that. Can you clarify?"
notify_user("Clawdbot asks", message)
edge_tts.speak(message)
ADHD-friendly handling is important: as one user notes, too many notifications train the brain to ignore
them. Notifications should be timely and adjustable in urgency
. For instance, allow the user to set a
ônag levelö so reminders escalate only when truly needed. Use toast(title, message, icon=..., 
on_click=...)  to customize content or actions
 (e.g. click-to-open links or scripts). 
Scenarios: Low-confidence answer, stalled workflow, upcoming deadline, long idle time, or
completion of a task. 
Implementation: Use win11toast.toast("Clawdbot", message)  in Python code when any
trigger condition is met
.
